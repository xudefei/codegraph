/**
 * Where saved trails live on disk — the only thing `codegraph ui` ever writes.
 *
 * Every other module under `api/` is a reader. This one holds the single write
 * path in the whole viewer, and it is scoped as narrowly as a write can be: one
 * directory, `<CODEGRAPH_DIR>/ui/trails/`, inside the project the server was
 * started on, one JSON file per trail. It never touches source, never touches
 * the index, and never writes anywhere a `codegraph init` would not already
 * have created. `.codegraph/.gitignore` ignores everything but itself, so a
 * saved trail is local by default; exporting one to commit is a copy the reader
 * makes deliberately.
 *
 * Two rules hold it inside the boundary described in `../security.ts`:
 *
 * - **The directory is resolved through `resolveProjectFile`**, exactly like a
 *   source read, so a trail id that tried to be a path is refused by the same
 *   chokepoint that refuses `?file=../../.ssh/id_rsa`. It is belt and braces on
 *   top of {@link isTrailId}, which already refuses anything but a slug.
 * - **A write is atomic.** Temp file in the same directory, then rename. A
 *   half-written trail read back by the list would look like a corrupt one, and
 *   the list would then have to decide whether to hide it — which is a decision
 *   nobody should have to make about a file they saved a second ago.
 *
 * The format is deliberately plain: a reader can open one in an editor, and a
 * hop is described by what it IS (a qualified name in a file) rather than by the
 * node id it happened to have. Node ids contain a start line, so any edit above
 * a symbol renames it — a trail keyed on ids would not survive its own project.

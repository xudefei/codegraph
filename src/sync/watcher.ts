/**
 * File Watcher
 *
 * Watches the project directory for file changes and triggers debounced sync
 * operations to keep the code graph up-to-date.
 *
 * Uses Node's built-in `fs.watch` directly (no third-party watcher, no native
 * addon) with a per-platform strategy chosen to keep the open-descriptor /
 * kernel-watch cost BOUNDED rather than growing with the number of files:
 *
 *   - macOS / Windows: a SINGLE recursive `fs.watch(root, {recursive:true})`.
 *     libuv maps this to one FSEvents stream (macOS) / one
 *     ReadDirectoryChangesW handle (Windows), so it costs O(1) descriptors no
 *     matter how large the tree. This is the fix for the macOS file-table
 *     exhaustion (#644 / #496 / #555 / #628): the previous watcher held one
 *     open fd PER WATCHED FILE on macOS (tens of thousands of REG fds), which
 *     exhausted `kern.maxfiles` and crashed unrelated processes system-wide.
 *
 *   - Linux: recursive `fs.watch` is unsupported, so we watch each (non-ignored)
 *     DIRECTORY with one inotify watch — O(directories), NOT O(files). New
 *     directories are picked up dynamically and an overall watch cap bounds
 *     inotify usage on pathological monorepos (#579). A single inotify watch on
 *     a directory already reports create/modify/delete for its children, so
 *     per-file watches are never needed.
 *
 * Excluded trees (node_modules/, dist/, .git/, …) are filtered via the
 * indexer's `buildScopeIgnore` (built-in default-ignore dirs + the project's
 * .gitignore) — on Linux they're never descended into (so they cost no watch),
 * and on macOS/Windows the single recursive stream still covers them but their
 * events are dropped before any sync is scheduled. Either way the watcher's
 * scope matches the indexer's (#276 / #407).
